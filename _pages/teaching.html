      [<a href="https://github.com/HannahHan3/Pharmacy_volume" target="_blank">Code files</a>]
      <br />Researched time series forecasting and compared classical algorithms with machine learning algorithms. 
       The use of machine learning approaches gave better results compared to classical time series methods. 
       Applied machine learning algorithms to the time series data to predict pharmacy drug volume, which is helpful for inventory management and staff scheduling. 
       Performed hyperparameter optimization to improve performance during training of the models. 
       Deployed the analytics results into everyday decision making process.
