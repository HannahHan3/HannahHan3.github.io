      [<a href="https://youtu.be/oN1HLSu_eW4" target="_blank">DemoVideo</a>]
      <br />Airbnb is always trying to improve the occupancy rates for their hosts. Both being able to
      understand what influences high booking rates, and being able to predict whether or not a particular
      listing is predicted to be a highly booked would help Airbnb identify listings that need help boosting their
      listings. This project is to provide solutions that allows for Airbnb to be able to accurately predict whether or not listings will be highly
      booked based on a certain set of predictor variables. Then Airbnb can implement tools or strategies for
      hosts of listings predicted to not be highly booked to increase the number of bookings for their listings.
