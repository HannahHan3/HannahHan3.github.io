[<a href="https://youtu.be/oN1HLSu_eW4" target="_blank">DemoVideo</a>]
<br />TurnAround is a spherical maze game built in a 3D platform. In this game, the player is required to start from a point of the sphere, walk along the sphere surface, avoid the walls of the maze, and reach the destination on the other side of the sphere. Four maze maps with different complexity are randomly generated and  provided to users. During the maze solving, users can use arrow keys to move forward, backward, left and right relatively to the camera. </td>

[<a href="https://youtu.be/oN1HLSu_eW4" target="_blank">DemoVideo</a>]
<br />Airbnb is always trying to improve the occupancy rates for their hosts. Both being able to
understand what influences high booking rates, and being able to predict whether or not a particular
listing is predicted to be a highly booked would help Airbnb identify listings that need help boosting their
listings. This project is to provide solutions that allows for Airbnb to be able to accurately predict whether or not listings will be highly
booked based on a certain set of predictor variables. Then Airbnb can implement tools or strategies for
hosts of listings predicted to not be highly booked to increase the number of bookings for their listings.</td>
