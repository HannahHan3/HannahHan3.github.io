I start <b>playing the piano </b>when I'm 8 years old. When i have no idea about something or want to excape from work, playing the piano is the first thing that comes to mind. 
I'm not a big fan of classical music, classical music is great, instead, I prefer some light and simple melody, make people feel relaxed and happy.

I learned <b>swimming</b> at Recreation Center in University of Maryland. I love it but i'm quite new.
