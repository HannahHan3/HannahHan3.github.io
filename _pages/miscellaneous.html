I left my hometown at the age of 14 to get a better education. I have the best parents in the world. No matter what happens, my parents always stand firm behind me. I enjoy the time when I get back to my hometown and spend time with them, I'm their little girl forever.  </p>

I started <b>playing the piano </b>when I was 8 years old. When i have no idea about something or want to escape from work, playing the piano is the first thing that comes to mind. 
I'm not a big fan of classical music, classical music is absolutely great, yet, I prefer some light and simple melody, which makes me feel relaxed and happy.

I learned <b>swimming</b> at Recreation Center in University of Maryland. I love it but i'm quite new.
