I'm Chinese Mongols, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_minorities_in_China" target="_blank">Ethnic minorities in China</a>.
  My hometown is a beautiful town on the border of Inner Mongolia province and Mongolia. 
  People in the town are kind, and we speak mongolian in daily life.
  I left my hometown at the age of 14 to get a better education. 
  I enjoy the time when I get back to my hometown and spend time with my parents, I'm their little girl forever.  </p>

I started <b>playing the piano </b>when I was 8 years old. Playing the piano is the first thing that comes to my mind when I want to enjoy the time alone and relax.  
I'm not a big fan of classical music, classical music is absolutely great, yet, I prefer some light and simple melody, which makes me feel relaxed and happy.

I learned <b>swimming</b> at Recreation Center in University of Maryland. I love it but I'm quite new at this.
